# Chair Entity Template

This template allows you to make any block with the term "chair" functional by right-clicking the block with an item in your hand.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance**: The seat entity is removed if there's no player using, or the block was destroyed. This ensures that the server doesn't get bogged down with unnecessary entities.
- **Easy Integration**: This template has all the same features as the vanilla seats script, just simplified and repackaged for general use in addons. For most simple cases, you can literally just copy the files and paste them. As long as it uses a stable version of scripts, it shouldn't break in updates.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Assassin1065/Chair-entity-template.git
